#TNDDR: Efficient and doubly robust estimation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness under the test-negative design

This repository is the official implementation of [Efficient and doubly robust estimation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness under the test-negative design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04578).

## Introduction

This study focuses on the derivation and evaluation of an efficient nonparametric estimator of vaccine effectiveness under an outcome-dependent sampling design known as the testnegative design (TND). This relatively new epidemiological design is currently being used globally to evaluate vaccine effectiveness for COVID, seasonal influenza, and other infectious diseases. It is extremely useful in the context of rapid vaccine evaluation since
it can be deployed in essentially real time. 

We derived the efficiency theory under the distribution arising from the biased TND sampling and a resulting one-step, doubly robust, and locally efficient estimator that can be implemented with machine learning methods. The properties of the proposed estimator are demonstrated theoretically and through simulation study. We then employ it to estimate the effectiveness of COVID-19 booster vaccination in a dataset of healthcare workers from the province of Qu√©bec, Canada.
